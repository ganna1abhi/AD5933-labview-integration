# pmodia-labview-integration

Courtsey Abhishek Gannarapu and Dr. Arda Gozen, Washington State University

This project provides the source code to talk to PmodIA, an impedance analizer chip (AD5933 microcontroller - Analog Devices), using Ardunio. 

We then developed a LabView program to communicate the chip through Arduino in LabView
